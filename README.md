# Project 2 - Flix

Flix is a movies app using the [The Movie Database API](http://docs.themoviedb.apiary.io/#).

Time spent: 8 hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

- [x] User can view a list of movies currently playing in theaters from The Movie Database.
- [x] Poster images are loaded using the UIImageView category in the AFNetworking library.
- [x] User sees a loading state while waiting for the movies API.
- [x] User can pull to refresh the movie list.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [x] User sees an error message when there's a networking error.
- [x] Movies are displayed using a CollectionView instead of a TableView.
- [x] User can search for a movie.
- [x] All images fade in as they are loading.
- [x] User can view the large movie poster by tapping on a cell.
- [x] For the large poster, load the low resolution image first and then switch to the high resolution image when complete.
- [x] Customize the selection effect of the cell.
- [x] Customize the navigation bar.
- [ ] Customize the UI.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] Superhero movies are displayed using the CollectionView.

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. Wrapping the text for the title and other design elements
2. Adding gesture recognizers to a certain area rather than an element

## Notes

The most difficult part of building this app was parsing the response from the API when fetching the trailer link. To fix this, I printed out each stage to figure out the types of various variables. Another difficult aspect of this app was implementing the search bar. To get the predicate function to work as expected, I had to make various tweaks to the textDidChange function.
